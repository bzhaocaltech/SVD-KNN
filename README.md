# SVD and KNN CPU and GPU Implementations

## CPU Implementations
To run KNN, first make sure you have a `data` directory in the root folder.
Then, run `create_test_data.py`. If you wish to generate new data, make sure to
manually delete old data before running the creation script again.
Then, run `make run_knn` and then `./run_knn`.

The generated KNN data has the following form. Each row represents a data point:
[`class`, `x_0`, `x_1`]

## GPU Implementations
Work in progress.
